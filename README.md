# Todo-List-TOP
JavaScript To-Do List Project for The Odin Project

## Pre-Project
- This project will be my second implementation of a to-do list ever, now as a more seasoned programmer and using JS rather than Python & Flask. 
- Will be continuing my practice in using Webpack, importing/exporting modules, writing cleaner code, using SOLID principles and OOP programming.
- Will try to make the app look nice and have pretty good overall UX/UI, but I will also be somewhat conservative with the design as I don't want to waste too much time and would prefer to continue moving forward with this curriculum.
